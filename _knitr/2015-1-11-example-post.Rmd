This is an R markdown post. You can just write like you would a normal markdown post, but you can also include `R` code. 

## The problem I had to solve

<div class="message">
 This is a little html block. It's nice to be able to use html alongside of markdown, but within this box, markdown isn't parsed.  
</div>



## Some R example

Proceed to write your awesome blog post, complete with reproducible and dynamically inserted plots and such. Below, I make a quick plot of an interaction matrix using the `metacom` package. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
	library(metacom)
	Imagine(matrix(rbinom(400,1,0.4), ncol=20,nrow=20))
```

Feel free to mix a bit of `html` in with your markdown if you're feeling frisky. Below, I use the `img` html tag to include a picture of a Turkish van cat.
