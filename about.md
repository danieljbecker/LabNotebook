## open lab notebook

eyo. i'm Daniel, a PhD student in the [Odum School of Ecology](http://www.ecology.uga.edu). I'm jointly advised by [Sonia Altizer](http://altizerlab.uga.edu) at UGA and [Daniel Streicker](http://streickergroup.wordpress.com) at the University of Glasgow. my research uses mathematical models, field studies of vampire bats, and analyses of large-scale human disease datasets to understand mechanistic links between changes to wildlife food resources and infectious disease dynamics and risk. for more information about my past and current projects, check out my [website](http://danieljbecker.weebly.com). 

this blog was created on the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) platform, templating from [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com),and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/danieljbecker).
