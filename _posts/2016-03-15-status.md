## things I did today
* `genetics` went to seminar
* `provphylo` felt better about handling outliers, worked on optim problem with gls
* `eabl` four hours of nestbox checks! sunburnt but fun to do fieldwork again
* `bartomod` read a lot about bat flies and their life history parameters
* `google` new citations feel good, emailed authors for PDFs (into `provphylo`!)

## things I should do tomorrow
* `biosci` prepare slides for Thursday presentation with Scott
* `bartomod` touch base with Richard, focus on outline and bat fly life cycle
* `peru` email Jorge, again, about his schedule and where my funds are going
* `provphylo` if I have time, try and refine hypotheses and predictor variables
