## things I did today
* `bartomod` ran `lhs` sampling across narrow range of parameter space but bat prevalence is still too high; switched over to using least squares to fit our model across a flat time series (~50%), which gives some promising parameter estimates and realistic prevalence
* `provphylo` made some solid headway on the introduction and added a table of hypotheses for micro/macroparasitism
* `bartonella` ordered master mix for next week's round of Loreto samples
* `peru` sent Ornela my estimate for missing samples, finally arranged for letters requesting the status of our convenio and for sample exportation to be sent on Friday
* `postdoc` sent some more emails
* `eeid2016` paid for housing and poster has been accepted, so time to revisit old analyses

## things I should do tomorrow
* `bka` meet with BioTek rep to help setup Gen5 protocols, order new bacterial pellets
* `peru` finalize and print INS and SERFOR documents on UGA letterhead
* `provphylo` fleshing out hypotheses in the introduction, dig into methods again
