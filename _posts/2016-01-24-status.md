## things I did today
* `vampireprov` added Blackwood 2011 seroprevalence data and compared livestock/seroprevalence curve with model. ODE simulations still freak out around the mid range of the provisioning vector, maybe check with Richard next week
* `lab` tested DNA extraction on Belize FTA cards from 2015, finished undergrad spring protocol/data sheet
* `genetics` read rest of papers
* `mycoplasma` got ClustalX up and running and sequences alligned, read chapters 1-3 of [Lemey](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/life-sciences/genomics-bioinformatics-and-systems-biology/phylogenetic-handbook-practical-approach-phylogenetic-analysis-and-hypothesis-testing-2nd-edition)

## things I should do tomorrow
* `grants` work on Lews & Clark Fund award
* `lab` walk through hematology with Ceci
* `peanutbutter` tutorial on meta-analysis
* `mycoplasma` keep moving through Lemey steps on making the tree
