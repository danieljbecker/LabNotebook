## status for December 14 

## things I did today

* `organize`: maybe got this notebook actually functioning.
* `batleuk`: revisited analyses using absolute latitude rather than the raw values. made some decisions on excluding the 2010 study since differential cell counts are never actually reported (and the total counts are likely too variable).
* `provmgmt`: made a little progress on my section of the review. good stuff to think carefully about with SICB and GSS coming up.
* `batrbcs`: scheduled a meeting to discuss the GSS poster with Ruth on Wednesday.

## things I should do tomorrow

* `peru`: email INS about sample export in January
* `provmgmt`: make some real headway on the competition and immune function section
* `sicb16`: start my SICB presentation (outline some slides, skeleton figures)
