## things I did today

* `organize`: maybe got this notebook actually functioning.
* `batleuk`: revisited analyses using absolute latitude rather than raw values.
* `provmgmt`: made a little progress on my section of the review. good stuff to think carefully about with SICB and GSS coming up.
* `batrbcs`: scheduled a meeting to discuss the GSS poster with Ruth on Wednesday.

## things I should do tomorrow

* `peru`: email INS about sample export in January
* `provmgmt`: make some real headway on the competition and immune function section
* `sicb16`: start my SICB presentation (outline some slides, skeleton figures)
* `lab`: read some blood slides from Peru 2015
