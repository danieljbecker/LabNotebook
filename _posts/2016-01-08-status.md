## things I did today
* `gss` ordered beer, sent Ruth poster to Sonia/Andy/Streicker
* `avianmeta` Biological Reviews rejected after heavy revise due to small n, so time to brainstorm next options, I also fixed analyses to incorperate the phylogenetic correlation matrix into random effect of species in metafor
* `provmgmt` read through Maureen's draft, added dilution references

## things I should do tomorrow
* `batleuk` write!
* `avianmeta` check in with Alex with new figs/results
* `peru` double check final shipping date from Lima
* `SISMID` look through 2015 Drake/Rohani notes and R code

## things I should do right before/after GSS
* `lab` get spectrometer set up for BKA, finish 2015 slides
* `bartonella` send PCR+ to sequence
* `mycoplasma` send Dmitry DNA aliquots
