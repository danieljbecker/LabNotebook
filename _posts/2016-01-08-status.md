## things I did today
* `gss` ordered beer, touch base with Ruth poster
* `avianmeta` Biological Reviews rejected due to small n so brainstorm next option, fixed analyses to incorperate phylogenetic correlation matrix into random effect of species in metafor
* `provmgmt` read through Maureen's draft, added dilution references

## things I should do tomorrow
* `batleuk` write!
* `gss` send peeps Ruth poster for last glance

## things I should do right before/after GSS
* `lab` get spectrometer set up for BKA, finish 2015 slides
* `bartonella` send PCR+ to sequence
* `mycoplasma` send Dmitry DNA aliquots
