## September
* `peru` three weeks of fieldwork in Loreto with samples from 29 vampire bats, rounding sample size per site out to 10-30 in this region. pretty good considering how remote these sites are and the low densities of livestock. we also have everything in place for permits and export.
* `bathg` wrote the introduction, halfway through the discussion, incorperated Wes's comments and Gabor's edits
* `fall2016` periodically ran analyses from Ceci's data collection
* `provphylo` advisors reviewing/editing, hope to send off in October to JAE
* `avianmeta` revised the meta-analysis, awaiting revision from RSOS
* `provmgmt` sent Maureen edits, awaiting revision from BC
* `reu` wrote intro and methods section of paper, awaiting comments from Richard and some simulations from Celine
* `bclab` excited to be moving forward with this lab project, a critical assessment of body condition measures and their association (or lack thereof) with infection measures
* `ceid` honored to be joining the advisory board, signed up to lead a workshop in November on my vampire bat work

## things I should do tomorrow
* `peru` send letter to Carlos, send SERFOR documents to World Courier
* `bathg` continue discussion
* `fall2016` check in with Ceci/Andre
* `lab` start more slides
* `life` make sure all emails from September have been addressed
