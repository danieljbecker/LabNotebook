## things I did today
* `esa2016` some progress, worked on code
* `provphylo` polished text, finished OSM, now just need to cut 600 words. i'm pretty happy with how the MS has come together and think it has a nice shot at JAE.
* `photo` some backyard bird shots, at least one solid [northern cardinal](https://www.flickr.com/photos/d_becker/28705446065/in/photostream/)
* `wisci` some nice progress with Virginia over a scicom workshop for the fall semester
