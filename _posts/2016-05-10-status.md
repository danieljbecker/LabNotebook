## things I did today
* `bartonella` nested PCR, almost done with Amazonas and Cajamarca 2015
* `bartomod` finished verifying parameters, ran simulations across narrower host-host susceptibilty term
* `peru` lots of INS emails, drafted some letters and data registry forms for export/management
* `postdoc` some more emails

## things I should do tomorrow
* `bartomod` run `lhs` sampling and try to get narrower bat prevalence range
* `provphylo` do a solid day of just rewriting; this is due to SA/DS in late May
