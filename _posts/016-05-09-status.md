## things I did today
* `bartonella` full round of nested PCR and gel, wrote code for model comparison, some preliminary plot code in place for looking at livestock density effects on site prevalence
* `provphylo` reworked introduction some, decided on how to move forward with outliers
* `bartomod` verified parameter sources, wrote Table 1

## things I should do tomorrow
* `bartonella` nested PCR on another set of ~12 samples, finish Amazonas and Cajamarca
* `bartomod` finish verifying parameters, run simulations across narrower host-host susceptibilty term
* `provphylo` rewrite introduction
* `postdoc` more emails
